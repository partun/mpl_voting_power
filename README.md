## Analysis of the Banzhaf Index Using National Council Voting Data
### Project for the 2019 ETH Lecture "Math in Politics and Law"



The Banzhaf voting power index provides a formula to calculate voting power. Voting power can be used to study fairness or political representation. However, by calculating the Banzhaf index of a voting body, we implicitly assume that all voter choose their vote at random. This report studies how these assumptions fail when applied to the Swiss National Council. To achieve this, we analyzed thousands of votes taken during the last eight years in the National Council.

This repository contains the voting data and the source code to the report.
